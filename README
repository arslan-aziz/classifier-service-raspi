This project uses Docker to deploy a web architecture that streams video from an IoT device (RaspPi),
performing CV transformations (use case to be decided), to a browser.

5/14/20:
- Video streams from the IoT device to the Flask web server via a Redis PubSub
- The web server maintains whether clients are connected or not in a Redis cache.
- The IoT device polls the webserver in a separate thread to update its state and determine whether to acquire video.
- The browser streams video to the browser (>30 fps on local net) as multipart/mixed data

TODO:
- Alternative queue/stream brokers to improve latency
- Implement image transformation/CV layer as a container
- Determine a user story to drive implementation of AI/ML features

Longshots:
- Productionize and deploy web server on cloud-service provider
- Build video capture into an Android mobile app
